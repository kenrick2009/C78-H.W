        <p id="cricket">My favourite hobby is Playing Cricket. I love to Play Cricket when I am bored. I love watching cricketers play like MS Dhoni, Virat Kohli, Jasprit Bumrah etc. Cricket can also bring other benefits and opportunities such as: Team skills. Social skills such as cooperation, communication and learning how to cope with winning and losing. It's a great way to meet new people and make new friends. </p></section>
